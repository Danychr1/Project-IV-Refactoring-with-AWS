# Project-IV-Refactoring-with-AWS

* About the Project
  * Project Name: Refactoring-with-AWS
  * Objective: To modernize and refactor a multi-tier web application stack by leveraging AWS cloud services. The goal is to enhance agility, reduce operational overhead, and streamline processes for improved business continuity.
 
* Current Scenario
The projectâ€™s services are hosted across a mix of physical, virtual, and cloud environments. Managing these services involves:

* Diverse Components: Various tools and services power the application runtime.
* Team Involvement: Multiple teams work collaboratively, including:
  - Cloud Computing Team
  - Virtualization Team
  - Data Center (DC) Operations Team
  - Monitoring Team
  - System Administrators

* Challenges:
  
   1 Operational Overhead: Excessive manual intervention.
  
   2 Downtime and Scaling Issues: Limited uptime and scalability.
 
   3 Cost Constraints: High upfront capital expenses (CapEx) and ongoing operational expenses (OpEx).
 
   4 Automation Gaps: Difficulty in automating infrastructure and processes.

 * Proposed Solution: 
   - To address these issues, we leveraged AWS-managed PaaS (Platform as a Service) and SaaS (Software as a Service) solutions. Key benefits include:

   a. Infrastructure as Code (IaC): Automate infrastructure deployment.
   
   b. Flexibility: Pay-as-you-go pricing model.
   
   c. Streamlined Management: Simplify infrastructure administration.
   
   d. Scalability: Automate scaling of services.
   
   e. Reduced Overhead: Eliminate the need for large operational teams.

* AWS Services Overview
 - Front-End Components
   * Elastic Beanstalk: Automates app deployment and scaling.
   * VM with Tomcat: Application server.
   * NGINX: Load balancing.
   * S3/EFS: Storage solutions for application data.
 - Back-End Components
   * RDS (Relational Database Service): Database management.
   * Elastic Cache: In-memory caching with Memcached.
   * Active MQ: Message brokering using RabbitMQ.
   * Route 53: DNS management.
   * CloudFront: Content delivery network (CDN) for fast content distribution.
  
  * Project Objectives
    
    1. Build Flexible Infrastructure: Adaptable and scalable.

    2. Minimize Costs: No upfront costs; pay-as-you-go model.
       
    3. Leverage PaaS and SaaS: Simplify management and boost agility.
   
    4. Automate Processes: Use IaC to reduce manual intervention.
